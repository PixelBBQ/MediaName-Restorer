The directory name is split into 4 sections.
For example 'Blade Runnner (1982) - [1080p][BR] Final Cut' is split into the following sections:

1 - 'Blade Runner' - movie name
2 - '(1982)'       - date
3 - '[1080p][BR]'  - quality
4 - 'Final Cut'    - version

The divider ' - ' is put between sections 2 and 3.


The following is the method I will use to create the program:

# 1. place old directory name as a txt file inside the directory. - [finished]
# 2. separate all parts of string with either a space or a dot dividing them. Remove spaces, dots and brackets from strings. - [finished]
# 3. find quality through grouping a number 3-4 digits long followed by a 'p'. - [finished]
# 4. find date by searching for a group of 4 digits, if two groups, choose the group closest to the end of the string. - [finished]
# 5. find the version by first searching for the word 'cut' if no word exists, move to step 6. If cut exists, check
# each word before it with a list of known version descriptions. If they match, store them in order of what word came
# first in the entire string. - [finished]
# 6. find the movie name by grouping any parts of the string that were not grouped by step 5 and come before the date. - [finished]
# 7. place groups order in a string (with divider '-' between section 2 and 3) and check all formatting is correct. - [finished]
# 8. rename the directory to the string. - [finished]
#

#
# Edit for 1.0:
# 1. Comment fully and clean code.
# 2. Make sure .txt file inside directory does not get overwritten.
# 2. Make sure that the quality section is in the correct order since there could be two strings in it.
# 3. Add file to save log to for debugging outside of terminal.
# 4. Include configuration file to set default root directory.
#
#
#
# Other bits:
# 1. If there are parts in front of the name that are separated from the name, make sure they are processed and do not end
# up in the movie name section.
#
#
#
# Possible additions:
# 1. If the automated process does not work, create a more manual, targetted option where the user enters as much info as
# they would like about the directory they have selected. The program will then solve the rest of the information and
# format it.
