The directory name is split into 4 sections.
For example 'Blade Runnner (1982) - [1080p][BR] Final Cut' is split into the following sections:

1 - 'Blade Runner' - movie name
2 - '(1982)'       - date
3 - '[1080p][BR]'  - quality
4 - 'Final Cut'    - version

The divider ' - ' is put between sections 2 and 3.


The following is the method I will use to create the program:

# 1. place old directory name as a txt file inside the directory.
# 2. separate all parts of string with either a space or a dot dividing them. Remove spaces, dots and brackets from strings.
# 3. find quality through grouping a number 3-4 digits long followed by a 'p'.
# 4. find date by searching for a group of 4 digits, if two groups, choose the group closest to the end of the string.
# 5. find the version by first searching for the word 'cut' if no word exists, move to step 6. If cut exists, check
# each word before it with a list of known version descriptions. If they match, store them in order of what word came
# first in the entire string.
# 6. find the movie name by grouping any parts of the string that were not grouped by step 5 and come before the date.
# 7. place groups order in a string (with divider '-' between section 2 and 3) and check all formatting is correct.
# 8. rename the directory to the string.
